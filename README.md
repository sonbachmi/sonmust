# MUST P2U

### Son Nguyen's PHP Assignment by Must Company

## Credentials Used

- MySQL database: `must_p2u`
- Username: `must_p2u`
- Password: `admin`
- Admin username: `admin`
- Admin password: `admin`
## Markup

PHP markup and code changes made directly to original theme templates

## Styling

Styling done with vanilla CSS to new custom stylesheets that override and extend the original from theme.

## Responsive Layout
Follows Figma design. Since the design does not include the hamburger menu, I assume this is intentional (?)
so I temporarily disable it from original code, while still keeping media queries.

Added minor fixes and improvements: meta viewport, theme color, fluid sizing based on relative `em` or `vw`, etc.
